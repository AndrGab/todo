#### Description: TODOlist
This is my final project for CS50.
This is a simple aplication to manage to-do lists.
Users can register themselves, logging in... and
add tasks to a SQlite database.
If the task is done, just click on the checkbox to make the
task checked.
To clean the actual list, just click on the Clear Checked Button.

## What is a ToDo List?
What is a ToDo List? The definition is a simple one.
Itâ€™s a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do.
Most typically, theyâ€™re organised in order of priority.
Traditionally, theyâ€™re written on a piece of paper or post it notes and acts as a memory aid.
As technology has evolved we have been able to create a todo lists with excel spreadsheets,
word documents, email lists, todo list apps, microsoft to do and google to do list to name a few.
You can use a to do list in your home and personal life, or in the workplace.
Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldnâ€™t forget
anything important.
