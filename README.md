#### Description: TODOlist
This is my final project for CS50.
This is a simple aplication to manage to-do lists.
Users can register themselves, logging in... and
add tasks to a SQlite database.
If the task is done, just click on the checkbox to make the
task checked.
To clean the actual list, just click on the Clear Checked Button.

Here is a simple explanation abou TODO lists:

What is a ToDo List?
What is a ToDo List? The definition is a simple one.
It’s a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do.
Most typically, they’re organised in order of priority.
Traditionally, they’re written on a piece of paper or post it notes and acts as a memory aid.
As technology has evolved we have been able to create a todo lists with excel spreadsheets,
word documents, email lists, todo list apps, microsoft to do and google to do list to name a few.
You can use a to do list in your home and personal life, or in the workplace.
Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldn’t forget
anything important. By prioritising the tasks in the list you plan the order in which you’re going
to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you
can leave until a little later

The Benefits of Using a To Do List
One of the most important reasons you should use a to
do list is that it will help you stay organised. When you write all your tasks in a list,
they seem more manageable. When you’ve got a clear outline of the tasks you’ve got to do and
those you’ve completed, it helps you stay focused. While freeing up space in your mind for other more creative tasks.

When you complete a task, you can cross it off your list. This gives you a sense of
progress and achievement, something you’ll lack if you’re always rushing from one task to the next.
If you feel a sense of achievement, it spurs you on and motivates you to keep moving forward.

But that’s not the only benefits of a to do list. Here are a few more:

Improves your memory: A to do list acts as an external memory aid. It’s only
possible to hold a few pieces of information at one time. Keep a to do list
and you’ll be able to keep track of everything, rather than just a few of the
tasks you need to do. Your to do list will also reinforce the information, which
makes it less likely you’re going to forget something.

Increases productivity: A to do list allows you to prioritize the tasks that are more
important. This means you don’t waste time on tasks that don’t require your immediate attention.
our list will help you stay focused on the tasks that are the most important.
Helps with motivation: To do lists are a great motivational tool because you
can use them to clarify your goals. You can divide your long-term goal into smaller,
more achievable short-term goals and as you tick each one off your list, your confidence will increase.
